# Elmish

**Fun.Blazor.Elmish** is the package to support this.

I know Elmish is loved by a lot of F# developers including me. At the beginning, when I start work on my first FSharp related task, I use Fable + Elmish, then migrated to Feliz + Elmish hooks + Recoil. At that time, I really enjoy it.

For the core concept, you can check [Elmish official docs, the real MVU (LOL)](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/)
